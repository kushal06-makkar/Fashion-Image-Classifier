👗 Fashion MNIST Classifier
A simple implementation of a Fashion MNIST image classification model built using Python and NumPy from scratch—no high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch!

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is Fashion MNIST by Zalando Research, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes such as shirts, shoes, bags, etc.

🔗 Download the dataset on Kaggle

🛠️ Features
Built entirely using Python and NumPy

Manual implementation of feedforward neural network

Softmax activation and cross-entropy loss

Trains on .csv version of the dataset (from Kaggle)

Predicts clothing categories from pixel data
